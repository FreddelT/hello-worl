I'm known as Freddie Thompson and a very young 51 year old, I'm also a musician but never really stopped programming since 1987 till the last two years where I was programming in Microsoft Visual Basic. I first started out programmiing in a language called PICK Basic in the 80s. After the company I was working for went bust in 2014 after 50 years (me being there for over 25 years), I've not done much since so I need to learn new languages and methods.
